Currently working as a mobile application developer @ [cookspace](https://cookspace.co) where I build hybrid mobile application with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and at scale. I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, and aerospace.

It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Road Rash,The House of the Dead 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and GTA: Vice City. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.\n\n- I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new PC. It took years for me to send my first email.\n\n\n- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.\n\n- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since.\n\n- At 16, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.\n\n- At 18, In the summer before University,to be exact March 30th 2019, I finally start writng code with Python.\n\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Traveling\n- HangOut with Friends\n- Space\n- Summer\n- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/mdangelo)\n- Colored pencils ([Faber-Castell Polychromos](https://www.faber-castell.com/products/art-and-graphic/polychromos))\n- Podcasts ([The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), [The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/), [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episodes/), [The Economist](http://radio.economist.com/), [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain), [Inquiring Minds](https://inquiring.show), and others)\n- [Good design](/)\n- [Photography](https://instagram.com/dangelosaurus)\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from Panchagarh, Rangpur, Bangaldesh.\n- I've been to 4 countries.\n- In 2008, I visited: India , Nepal and Bhutan\n- In 2017, I visited: revisit Indea.\n- In 2021, I hope to start traveling again and visit Keokradong(3rd higest Peak in Bangladesh)\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I have just watched 5-7 movies and two Web series in my whole life.\n- I almost always have a sketchbook with me and a [01 Sakura Pigma Micron Pen](https://www.sakuraofamerica.com/product/pigma-micron/).\n- I can't locate every country on a map.\n- I operate a [small angel fund](http://skepticalinvestments.biz/) with terrible returns.\n- I added this page because so many people complained that my site was just my resume.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- I want to retired before 30\n- always finding inspiration.\n- enabling a brighter future.\n- doing better.\n\n# Peoples I admire\n\n- [Angela Yu](https://twitter.com/yu_angela?lang=en)\n- [Andrew Mead](https://twitter.com/andrew_j_mead?lang=en)\n\nIf we are friends and you feel like you belong on this list, you're probably right.
